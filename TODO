- secure service_defs.p pickle with signature
- manage unrecognized realms / have a "ServiceWall:unknown" profile
- improve logging : + a private log collecting process sorting by date and port
                    + this collector resolve hostnames
                    + access control limited to group network

- FireWall logs : tell the essid the drop happened in OR tell the current realm
- braise show logs : then, print the current realm as default in logs
- braise show logs : variations : improve pattern matching with each found item

- perhaps braise add match MATCH toRule RULE
- let autocompletion check for iptables modules (in python-iptables ?)
- let this be done in a separate script to compartiment autocompletion
- perhaps braise add rule RULE toChain { input | output }

- XTABLES_LIBDIR doesn't get set to /usr/lib/iptables in raspberry Arch as it
  should, don't know why

- have decent argparse help pages
- don't propose "-h" in completion

- on add service, DEBUG output
- on service start, print service only once

- be more verbose on composition of the table

- explain stateful rules - why do we accept ICMP, reject INVALID

- NetworkService and NetworkRule classes

### DONE

- support for additional service defs
- braise add service --in-default-profile
- braise show logs : propose to see hostnames as braise show logs --with-hostnames
- have port ranges in services.p->service->ports because some have thousands, making the pickle huge.
- use realms.p [and services.p ?] as a template, instanciate in /etc/servicewall
