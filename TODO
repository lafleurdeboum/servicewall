- secure service_defs.p pickle with signature
- manage unrecognized realms / have a "ServiceWall:unknown" profile
- improve logging : + a private log collecting process sorting by date and port
                    + this collector resolve hostnames
                    + access control limited to group network

- FireWall logs : tell the essid the drop happened in OR tell the current realm
- braise show logs : then, print the current realm as default in logs
- braise show logs : variations : improve pattern matching with each found item

- perhaps braise add match MATCH toRule RULE
- let autocompletion check for iptables modules (in python-iptables ?)
- let this be done in a separate script to compartiment autocompletion
- perhaps braise add rule RULE toChain { input | output }

- have decent argparse help pages
- don't propose "-h" in completion

- on add service, DEBUG output
- on service start, print service only once ?

- be more verbose on composition of the table

- explain stateful rules - why do we accept ICMP, reject INVALID

- NetworkService and NetworkRule classes
