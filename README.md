# ServiceWall

## Target audience

You have a personal device that you use as a client. You already know that some
services need to use ports on the network card, such as Skype, MORPGames, or
sharing files with someone using Samba, local games ...

And you run a linux kernel and Network Manager

You want a firewall that drops invalid traffic whatsoever, and allows "some"
services at home for people at home, and usually less when you're in a ...
random place.

This firewall adapts to the changes in the connection provider's declared name
(the ESSID), using a set of rules for each of these realms. It stores the list
of allowed services for each ESSID it meets in a dictionary, starting with a
customisable default, adding the services you tell it to (for good).

## Installation

As the header goes, install it with :

 `# pip install servicewall`

This software needs python 3 and python-iptables to work. It also relies on
Network Manager's dispatcher to fire the events on connectivity change. Any network
event dispatcher would do, just need to call `toggler`. To locate the file, check :

  `# pip show -f servicewall`

## Usage

The firewall is disabled by default. To enable it now and at boot-time :

  `# braise enable`

and the corresponding `disable`.

Once started, the default behaviour is to drop all that come in, excepted for
some community-useful services (details on this TODO). All that go out is
allowed.

To have details on the status, use :

  `# braise show status`

TODO change to `braise status`
If it doesn't reply at all, then obviously the firewall is down.

To allow a specific service, do :

  `# braise add "Service Name"`

which will add this service to this realm's definition. If you connect to
internet in another place, the rules for this place (identified by the ESSID of
the connection) will be put aside, and brought back when you connect to it
again. All this supports completion with python-argcomplete ; TODO the file is
added in /etc/bash_completion.d/.

Don't know what's the name of the service you want to allow ? You'll need to :

  `# braise show services`

The list is quite long. Once you want exhaustive informations on a single
service, do

  `# braise show service "Service Name"`

These rules are stored in a dictionary called realm_defs. To interrogate it, do :

  `# braise show realms`

And in the end, the firewall logs all that it drops ; there's a log processor
tool included ; try it with

  `# braise show logs`

or

  `# braise show logs since NUMBER_OF_SECONDS`
